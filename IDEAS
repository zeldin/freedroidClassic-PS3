New graphics design, Possible solutions:
    1. Stay with Ball and number design
       + simpler
       + easyer to tell droids apart and to classify a droid
       + less renderings and images required
       + design stays invariant under direction changes of the droid

    2. Change to individual renderings of all droids
       + possibly better graphical impression
       - requires handling of the directions a droid is facing
       - requires renderings of ALL droids
       - might make it difficult to tell droid types apart

For now, we stick to the first path, I think all aggreed.  Additions? Comments? jp.

Extension idea:  Friendly droid communication
  I thought of the following nice idea, which would also reposition the game more into
the adventure/roleplaying genre.  Recently, friendly droids were introduced.  They can
be defined easily from the droids file of a mission.  But what happens when you try to
takeover one of those friendly droids?  ---  We might just cause some text interaction
like in a dialog where you can talk to the droid, ask it to do this or that.  With this,
we could reshape the game so that the influencer at some point of the mission comes into
towns with robots, where you can talk to a lot of "people" and solve difficult problems
not only with fighting, but also with non-violent interaction with droids.  You might
also find some droids to accompany you in your travels.

Now this is of course all far away.  We might just stick to the interaction possibility
for now.  Change of missions and story line that way can also be discussed later.
But what do you think?  Would that be the type of game you would like to see implemented
or would you prefer to stick to acion/arcade contents?  Comments?  Addisions?  jp.

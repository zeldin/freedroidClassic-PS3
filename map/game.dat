This is a data file for Freedroid.
It contains the specification of all droids appearing in freedroid.
You can edit it with a standard text editor of your choice.
Feel free to make any modifications you like.
Freedroid will still accept you modified game dada file as long
as you stick to the following rules:
1.) the Text indicating the Start of the Robot Data Section must not
    be removed or changed.  It is needed by Freedroid in order to find
    the robot section in your modified file.


Lets see if it makes sense.

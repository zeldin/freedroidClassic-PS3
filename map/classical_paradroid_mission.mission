--------------------------------------------------
This is a mission file for Freedroid.
--------------------------------------------------

This mission is named "New Mission 1".

--------------------------------------------------

The structure of a mission file is simple.
* There must be a starting string indicating the
  start of the real mission data.
* A mission name must be specified
* A mission briefing text must be specified
* A mission target must be specified.
* A "ship" must be specified, where a "ship" could also
  be for example a small automated mining community or
  a building complex somewhere on a planet.
* A crew file must be specified, where the information which
  droids are to be generated in which levels can be found.
* A "game.dat" file must be specified, containing all the
  droid specifications and the constants for the game
  physics.
* An elevator file must be specified.
* A missing file termination string should be present to indicate
  the end and the integrity of the mission file.

What all these strings must look like can easily deduced 
directly form the following example.

* New Mission Briefing Text Subsection *
A fleet of Robo-freighters on its way to the Beta Ceti system reported entering an uncharted field of asteroids. Each ship carries a cargo of battle droids to reinforce the outworld defences. Two distress beacons have been discovered. Similar Messages were stored on each. The ships had been bombarded by a powerful radionic beam from one of the asteroids. All of the robots on the ships, including those in storage, became hyper-active. The crews report an attack by droids, isolating them on the bridge. They cannot reach the shuttle and can hold out for only a couple more hours.  Since these beacons were located two days ago, we can only fear the worst.  Some of the fleet was last seen heading for enemy space. In enemy hands the droids can be used against our forces. Docking would be impossible but we can beam aboard a prototype Influence Device.

The 001 Influence Device consists of a helmet, which, when placed over a robots control unit can halt the normal activities of that robot for a short time. The helmet has its own energy supply and powers the robot itself, at an upgraded capability. The helmet also uses an energy cloak for protection of the host. The helmet is fitted with twin lasers mounted in a turret. These can be focussed on any target inside a range of eight metres. Most of the device's resources are channelled towards holding control of the host robot, as it attempts to resume 'normal' operation. It is therefore necessary to change the host robot often to prevent the device from burning out. Transfer to a new robot requires the device to drain its host of energy in order to take ist over. Failure to achieve transfer results in the device being a free agent once more.

An Influence Device can transmitt data to your console.  A small-scale plan of the whole deck is available, as well as a side elevation of the ship. Robots are represented on-screen as a symbol showing a three-digit number. The first digit shown is the important one, the class of the robot. It denotes the strength also. To find out more about any given robot, use the robot enquiry system at a console. Only data about units of a lower class than your current host is available, since it is the host's security clearance which is used to acces the console.

Controls

The game is controlled via keyboard input or via joystick input.
The joystick control is similar to keyboard control.
Therefore only keyboard control is expained here:

Use cursor keys to move around.  The speed you can go depends on the druid you currently control.

If you press space bar in -addition- to a cursor key, this fires the weapon of the druid you currently control.


If you press space bar whilst NOT pressing a cursor key, this will enter transfer mode.  You will notice your robot to take on a flashy red color.  Now if you touch some other druid, this will initiate the takeover process in which you have to win a small game of logical curcuits within the given time.
If you succeed, you thereafter can control this new droid and for game purposes, it is as if you were him.
If you loose, you either are destroyed if you didn't control an enemy druid at that time, or the host you controlled is destroyed together with the unit you wished to control.

The P key causes the game to pause.
The S key causes a screenshot to be taken.
The Escape key causes the menu to pop up.

Watch out for energy refreshing fields and elevators.

Lifts are also entered via transfer mode if you stand still on the lift

Success!!! Congratulations!!
You have made it!

The thread of action is continued, but the next mission takes place several years after the asteroid field incident....  However this incident is not forgotten.  Some scientists remembering the story and the first construction of the influence device, a project, that has been abandoned after this.  The scientists reconstruct the device from archive data... It's their last hope to survive.  But read all the details in the next mission's briefing...

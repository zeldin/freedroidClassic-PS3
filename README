A game available for Linux only by Johannes Prix, Reinhard Prix and Rene Limarutti.
(c) 1992-2002 by Reinhard Prix, Johannes Prix and Rene Limarutti.

Introduction
============
This is a nice clone of the classic game "Paradroid" on Commodore 64
with some improvements and extensions to the classic version.

Getting started
===============
Just 'cd' to the directory 'freeparadroidplus' and type 'para'.
If that doesn't help, read the file TROUBLESHOOTING. 

The Game
========
In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with a
few numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several decks
connected by elevators.
The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small black
balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing control over them
by creating connections in a short subgame of electric circuits.

Input Devices
=============

Currently, the only way to control the white robot is via keyboard, using
the cursor keys and the space key.  Cursors are for moving aroung and aiming.
Space bar is for fireing (with direction) or for changing to transfer mode,
a prerequisite for seizing control over an enemy druid.

The Level Editor
================
There was a level editor with the MS-DOS Version of this game, which we
programmed back in 1992-1994, but it has not been ported to Linux and there
are some minor modifications in map encoding.  It might well happen, that 
from some point on this editor will be supplied too with the package, but
then on the other hand maybe not.

Saving
======
No, saving is not possible.  Not now and not in the near future.  Sorry.
But I think that would also take away much of the game difficulty, and we
havn't designed another ship yet...

Contact
=======
In case of problems, read the documentation as good a possible, and if that
doesn't help, mail to johannes.prix@kfunigraz.ac.at, that's me.  And I usually
reply rather promptly.

And Now Have Fun!

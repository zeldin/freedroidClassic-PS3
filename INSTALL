Freedroid Installation 
======================
[ 0) if you have downloaded your source from the cvs-archive 
   you have to start by typing `./autogen.sh']

1) type `./configure'
2) type `make' to compile the package

**) If you have the release 0.7.3 or earlier, you run the game by typing
   `cd src', followed by `./freedroid'

**) if you have a release later than 0.7.3 or you downloaded it from 
   the cvs tree, you have three options to run the game:

   3a) install the package by typing `make install' 
   You have to be root to do this, as this will try to install freedroid in 
   /usr/local/bin, and the data-files in /usr/local/share/freedroid.

   3b) If you're not root on this machine or you don't want a global 
	installation, you can optionally specify a different
	install-location, by typing:

	`make clean; make prefix=<your-install-dir>'  followed by
	`make install prefix=<your-install-dir>'

	This will install the executable in <your-install-dir>/bin
	and the data-files in <your-install-dir>/share/freedroid
	
   3c) You can also run the game without installing at all by  typing

	   `make clean; make pkgdatadir=..'

	   In this case you run the game by typing: 
	   `cd src', followed by `./freedroid'

Have fun!

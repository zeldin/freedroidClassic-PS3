Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:
DONE Take a look at the possibilities of the SDL Library BFont
IN PROGRESS.. Use these possibilities to write a better Options menu
DONE Include a LEVELEDITOR option in the options menu
DONE Include GAMMA correction option in the options menu
DONE Include Sound Volume correction in the options menu
DONE Add an SDL-Font based Framerate-Display-Option, that can also be
   toggled from the options menu
1. write the Frame
2. Test if the time-distortion with space happens also in other window managers
6. Make a new attempt on dumping the yiff.  This time i'll 
   try to be more clever ;-)
7. Make an attempt on highlighting fields to pioneer for the
   leveleditor I would like to see conveniently integrated into the game
   sooner or later.
8. Add the original energy-upload-function from the C64 classical game start
   to FreeDroid (instead of BeamLine perhaps...)
9. Add more documentation concerning framerate calculation
?. Try to locate the bug in the influ-wall collision routines that dump the
   influ completely far away (several blocks) and sometimes even outside the ship!
?. Try to start level editing functions in FreeDroid and perhaps merge
   the maped functions somehow into the main code in a leveled.c file or so.
?. Make an attemt to change to TrueColor mode (that means all image-operations have
   to be set to word pointers or whatever two bytes are called)

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

1. correct bugs in autoconf/automake/configure (esp. path to SDL includes!!)
2. consider putting compression into cvs as suggested by  Frode Haugsgjerd
3. put proper timing in takeover game
4. chase SegFault bug that might come from my new getchar_raw() or GetString()
   functions, and happens mostly after Highscore-entry (func. Debriefing())
5. Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery

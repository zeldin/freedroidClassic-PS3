Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:
IN PROGRESS... Try to start level editing functions in FreeDroid and perhaps merge
   the maped functions somehow into the main code in a leveled.c file or so.
   The rest (saving) is up to rp.

1. Reactivate the concept view (useful for testing purposes...)

2. Make a new attempt on dumping the yiff.  This time i'll 
   try to be more clever ;-)  But only if SDL performs as good as the yiff.

3. Reactivate "Color Rotation" of Bulletcolor, but WITHOUT using the palette for
   this.  This will be good to for later, if someone designs new and better animated
   bullets with multiple pictures in EACH direction.

4. Add more documentation concerning framerate calculation

5. Make an attemt to change to TrueColor mode (that means all image-operations have
   to be set to word pointers or whatever two bytes are called)

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

*) "clean-up" code, esp. get rid of all the obsolete "Screens"..
*) Takeover game: rahmen, points etc + Keyboard-sensitivity better
*) have a look at Map-editor and save-function
*) putting cvs compression hint on homepage
*) Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery

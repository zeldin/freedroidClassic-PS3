Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:

THESE ITEMS HAVE FIRST PRIORITY:
--------------------------------

4. Think of a way new tiles can be incorporated into the game
5. Add documentation about how to incorporate new map tiles into the game

7. Add additional map tiles:  destroyed console left/right/up/down 
   but only a dummy and leave the details to the creative people
8. Add additional map tiles:  autoshooting gun left/right/up/down
   but only a dummy and leave the details to the creative people

9. Analyze the lift data file:  Think of how it works and write some more
   documentation and perhaps make it a bit better human-readable.

10. Remove all german from the code

11. Allow for more than one 'phase' of the bullet, especially now that there
    is only one native picture anyway

12. Enable mod files as well for the background music

*  Add code to animate the autoshooting gun
*  Add new weapon type: laser: drawing (double) lines from source to target.
*  Add new weapon type: dumb missile 
*  Add new weapon type: homing missile
*  Add old explosions of larger size to make the game graphically more advanced
*  Add old sparks and lightning flash on a robot to make the game graphically
   more advanced
*  Add new third mission with bomb defusal mission target and heavy guard and
   time limit for the defusal of the bomb.
*  Add surface lift to the asteroid map, that should not be accessible from the start.


2. Extend the game/graphics engine
   b. Takeover graphics effect (alpha-blending?) should be added
   d. dimensions of combat window should be enlarged vertically
   e. use fixed pictures for each droid.  when no image found-->generate generic ones
   h. add new tiles: barred door horizontally/vertically (of about wall size)

3. Extend the freedroid world/missions
   * (Outline for later:  other settings: )
   * Command cyborg experiment facility (999, 998, 997, ... 990),
   * Mining community
   * Police station, where a rebel is held
             
4. New combat behaviour
   a. introduce reaction time:  States and decisions only made every e.g. 2 seconds or so.
      (that should give the player a chance to compete.  Otherywise they might become too powerful.)
   b. analyze current state and set flags: WILL_BE_HIT_BY_BULLET
   c.                                      HAVE_DIRECT_LINE_OF_FIRE_AT_INFLU
   d.                                      HAVE_BETTER_WAYPOINT
   e. split up state machines for fireing and movement
   f. movement to new waypoint immediately if threatened by enemy fire

THESE ITEMS ARE OF SECOND PRIORITY:
-----------------------------------

(?). Put combat background music to play into the ship file
     for every deck.

(?). Restore the rest of the animation of Refreshes

(?) Add more doku extra lines to the 
    a. external game dat file, 
    b. droids files and 
    c. mission files.

-1. Write doku on how to control the game

THESE ITEMS ARE OF THIRD PRIORITY:
----------------------------------

(?) Update the task list on the sourceforge

(?) Read more about SDL_net &&  Add networking support

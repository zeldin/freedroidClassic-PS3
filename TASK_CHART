Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I´m going to work on next:
1. Take a look at the possibilities of the SDL Library BFont
2. Use these possibilities to write a better Options menu
3. Include a LEVELEDITOR option in the options menu
4. Include GAMMA correction option in the options menu
5. Include Sound Volume correction in the options menu
6. Make a new attempt on dumping the yiff.  This time i´ll 
   try to be more clever ;-)
7. Make an attempt on highlighting fields to pioneer for the
   leveleditor I would like to see conveniently integrated into the game
   sooner or later.
?. Try to locate the bug in the influ-wall collision routines that dump the
   influ completely far away (several blocks) and sometimes even outside the ship!
?. Try to start level editing functions in FreeDroid and perhaps merge
   the maped functions somehow into the main code in a leveled.c file or so.
?. Make an attemt to change to TrueColor mode (that means all image-operations have
   to be set to word pointers or whatever two bytes are called)

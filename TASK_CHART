Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:

THESE ITEMS HAVE FIRST PRIORITY:

0. Extend the level Editor
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to show waypoint connections
   b. Extend the Level Editor to allow for resizing of decks
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to allow for changing of color
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to allow for changing of deck map
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to connect new waypoints to other waypoints 
   f. Allow to change the level name
   DONE Write doku for the usage of the level editor
   DONE Do segfault protection from planting tiles outside map structure
   i. Allow for more things to be set directly: Elevators & Boxes

1. Introduce "Mission" files consisting of:
   a. Mission target specification: KILLALL, REACH_POS, KILL_TYPE
   DONE Briefing text
   c. EndTitle text
   DONE "Ship" to be loaded
   e. Next mission file after completition of mission
   f. Add a function "CheckMissionSuccess" for a.

5. Write a new ship/area for testing purposes: "The mining community"
   2.a One deck at least.
   2.b A second deck
   2.c One elevator connecting them
   2.d Draw a side elevation of the mining asteroid
   2.e Outline:  Command cyborg experiment facility (999, 998, 997, ... 990),
                 Mining community
                 Police station
             
3.   Implement the new and advanced combat behaviour:
     * Introduce reaction time:  States and decisions only made every e.g. 2 seconds or so.
       That should give the player a chance to compete.  Otherywise they might become too powerful.
     * Analyze current state and set flags: WILL_BE_HIT_BY_BULLET, HAVE_DIRECT_LINE_OF_FIRE, HAVE_BETTER_WAYPOINT
     * Fireing state machine && Movement state machine: both independent decision processes
     * Changing of waypoints not randomly but decision as demanded
       by the combat situation
     * Movement to new waypoint immediately if threatened by enemy fire

(?) Try to introduce an external file for game constants so that mods can be
    made without looking into the code.
    a. Blast radius
    b. Bullet damage

THESE ITEMS ARE OF SECOND PRIORITY:

(?). Put combat background music to play into the ship file
     for every deck.

(?). Restore the animation of Refreshes

(?). Adapt the crew file format, so that you can enter types by
     their names instead of their numbers

-1. Write doku on how to control the game

THESE ITEMS ARE OF THIRD PRIORITY:

(?) Read more about SDL_net &&  Add networking support

(?) Reactivate "Color Rotation" of Bulletcolor, but WITHOUT using the palette for
    this.  This will be good to for later, if someone designs new and better animated
    bullets with multiple pictures in EACH direction.
    --->  Will this really make sense?  What if someone designed fine new multicolored shots?

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

*) "clean-up" code, esp. get rid of all the obsolete "Screens"..
*) Takeover game: rahmen, points etc + Keyboard-sensitivity better
*) have a look at Map-editor and save-function

*) Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery
--> Perhaps get the save routine in the leveleditor to work?? just a suggestion

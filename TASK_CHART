Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:

DONE Correct the console text display

DONE Rescaling of Map should be working for Level Editor but not
     for real game

DONE Downscale Bastians graphics to fit into the console.

DONE Introduce questioning screen at the beginning asking 
     which mission to load ClassicParadroid/New

(?). Put combat background music to play into the ship file
     for every deck.

(?). Restore the animation of Refreshes

DONE Speed up the loading and interpreting time for the map file

DONE Correct the aggression of droids

DONE Introduce a flag for new and advanced combat behaviour
     some new robots

DONE Read in the flag for new and advanced combat behaviour

3.   Implement the new and advanced combat behaviour:
     * Analyze current state and set flags: WILL_BE_HIT_BY_BULLET, HAVE_DIRECT_LINE_OF_FIRE, HAVE_BETTER_WAYPOINT
     * Fireing state machine && Movement state machine: both independent decision processes
     * Changing of waypoints not randomly but decision as demanded
       by the combat situation
     * Movement to new waypoint immediately if threatened by enemy fire

(?). Adapt the crew file format, so that you can enter types by
     their names instead of their numbers

DONE Add instructions for using the Level editor in Freedroid perhaps on the home page

DONE Split the home page up into the home page and a manual/leveleditor manual html file

-1. Write doku on how to control the game

0. Extend the level Editor
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to show waypoint connections
   b. Extend the Level Editor to allow for resizing of decks
   c. Extend the Level Editor to allow for changing of color
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to allow for changing of deck map
   DONE Extend the Level Editor to connect new waypoints to other waypoints 
   f. Allow to change the level name
   DONE Write doku for the usage of the level editor
   DONE Do segfault protection from planting tiles outside map structure
   i. Allow for more things to be set directly: Elevators & Boxes

1. Introduce "Mission" files consisting of:
   a. Mission target specification: KILLALL, REACH_POS, KILL_TYPE
   DONE Briefing text
   c. EndTitle text
   DONE "Ship" to be loaded
   e. Next mission file after completition of mission
   f. Add a function "CheckMissionSuccess" for a.

5. Write a new ship/area for testing purposes: "The mining community"
   2.a One deck at least.
   2.b A second deck
   2.c One elevator connecting them
   2.d Draw a side elevation of the mining asteroid
   2.e Outline:  Command cyborg experiment facility (999, 998, 997, ... 990),
                 Mining community
                 Police station
             

DONE Introduce new robots 

(?) Try to introduce an external file for game constants so that mods can be
    made without looking into the code.
    a. Blast radius
    b. Bullet damage

(?)  LATER: Read more about SDL_net &&  Add networking support

(?) Reactivate "Color Rotation" of Bulletcolor, but WITHOUT using the palette for
    this.  This will be good to for later, if someone designs new and better animated
    bullets with multiple pictures in EACH direction.

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

*) "clean-up" code, esp. get rid of all the obsolete "Screens"..
*) Takeover game: rahmen, points etc + Keyboard-sensitivity better
*) have a look at Map-editor and save-function

*) Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery
--> Perhaps get the save routine in the leveleditor to work?? just a suggestion

Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:
IN PROGRESS... Try to start level editing functions in FreeDroid and perhaps merge
   the maped functions somehow into the main code in a leveled.c file or so.
   The rest (saving) is up to rp.

1. Reactivate the concept view (useful for testing purposes...)

2. Reactivate "Color Rotation" of Bulletcolor, but WITHOUT using the palette for
   this.  This will be good to for later, if someone designs new and better animated
   bullets with multiple pictures in EACH direction.

?. Add more documentation concerning framerate calculation

?. Make an attemt to change to TrueColor mode (that means all image-operations have
   to be set to word pointers or whatever two bytes are called)

?. Clean up the Concole text descriptions

(?). Make a new attempt on dumping the yiff.  This time i'll 
     try to be more clever ;-)  But only if SDL performs as good as the yiff.

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

1. correct bugs in autoconf/automake/configure (esp. path to SDL includes!!)
2. consider putting compression into cvs as suggested by  Frode Haugsgjerd
3. put proper timing in takeover game
4. chase SegFault bug that might come from my new getchar_raw() or GetString()
   functions, and happens mostly after Highscore-entry (func. Debriefing())
5. Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery

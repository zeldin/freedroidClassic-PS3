Rough overview of involved developers and their attributed tasks :
(for better orientation only!)

- "low level" graphics (SDL) and sound functions
- sound issues, all of them.
- more doku!
- Web-page admin
- public relations ;)

The list of things I'm going to work on next:

(?) Try to introduce an external file for game constants so that mods can be
    made without looking into the code.

(?) Try to introduce an external file for robot description so that mods can be
    made without looking into the code.

(?)  write dokumentation about the new format for levels and maps.

(?)  LATER: Read more about SDL_net &&  Add networking support

(?) Reactivate "Color Rotation" of Bulletcolor, but WITHOUT using the palette for
   this.  This will be good to for later, if someone designs new and better animated
   bullets with multiple pictures in EACH direction.

- cvs archive mangagement
- Takeover game
- Lift & ship view
- map-editor (maped)
- Automake/configure/Makefile 
- cheatmenu

more detailed list of planned activities:

*) "clean-up" code, esp. get rid of all the obsolete "Screens"..
*) Takeover game: rahmen, points etc + Keyboard-sensitivity better
*) have a look at Map-editor and save-function

*) Add the Homepage-Makefile into the general autoconf/automake machinery
--> Perhaps get the save routine in the leveleditor to work?? just a suggestion
